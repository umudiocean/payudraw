The trajectory outlines the end-to-end development of a Payu Squid Game themed cryptocurrency lottery web application. The process began with a highly detailed product specification from the user, covering user flow, UI/UX design based on the Squid Game theme, smart contract integration on the BSC mainnet, backend API requirements, and an admin panel.

The AI engineer executed this plan by first setting up the frontend and backend structure. Initial development focused on establishing the blockchain connection using Wagmi and RainbowKit and building the core UI components and pages (Home, Join, My Entries, Admin). The UI was iteratively refined based on direct user feedback, which included:
1.  Enhancing the countdown timer to a static 45-day display with more animations.
2.  Rebranding from Squid Game to Payu Squid Game and replacing the logo.
3.  Adding a promotional giveaway banner to the footer.
4.  Changing the background from a solid black to a dynamic, themed image.
5.  Implementing a multi-language framework (i18next) with a language selector for 10 languages.

The most recent task was a refactor to remove all mentions of the 0.00098 BNB entry fee from the UI and all language translation files, which was interrupted mid-process.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a Vercel-hosted web application for a cryptocurrency lottery inspired by Squid Game.

**Core User Flow:**
1.  **Landing Page:** Users are greeted with a themed hero section, a countdown timer for the draw, and a Join Draw CTA.
2.  **Wallet Connection:** Users connect their crypto wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.) via RainbowKit.
3.  **Participation:** Upon connecting, users call the  function on a BSC mainnet smart contract (), which sends 0.00098 BNB. In return, they instantly receive 250M PAYU coins and a unique ticket number (e.g., ).
4.  **Post-Registration:** Users see their ticket number and optional tasks (e.g., join Telegram).

**Key Features:**
-   **UI/UX:** A dark, high-contrast theme using a specific color palette (Neon Pink, Teal), geometric shapes (◯ △ ⬜), and custom fonts (Satoshi/Inter). The theme was later updated to use a specific background image and the official Payu logo.
-   **Admin Panel:** A hidden, wallet-gated page () accessible only by  for viewing participants and exporting data.
-   **Countdown Timer:** A 45-day countdown displayed prominently on the landing page and in the header.
-   **Multi-Language Support:** The application must support 10 languages (EN, TR, ES, DE, FR, RU, AR, ZH, PT, ID) with a user-selectable language switcher.
-   **Textual Updates:** All instances of Squid Game were to be replaced with Payu Squid Game. All mentions of the entry fee were to be removed from the UI.
</product_requirements>
<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js with Create React App (CRACO).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme configuration for Squid Game aesthetics.
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI components located in .
- **Blockchain Integration**: Wagmi and RainbowKit for wallet connectivity and smart contract interaction on the BSC Mainnet.
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI (Python).
- **Database**: MongoDB (initial setup), intended for Vercel Postgres.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**:  and  for multi-language support.
</key_technical_concepts>
<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard monorepo structure with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files:**
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**
    -   **Importance**: The main entry point for the React application. It sets up the routing structure (), wraps the application with necessary providers like , , and initializes  for translations.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily modified to include routing for Home, Join, MyEntries, and the Admin page. Providers for wallet connection and internationalization were added.

-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/Home.js**
    -   **Importance**: The landing page of the application. It contains the main hero section, the countdown timer, feature descriptions, and the promotional giveaway banner.
    -   **Changes**: Underwent multiple significant visual updates: text changed from Squid Game to Payu Squid Game, the logo was replaced, the background was updated to a user-provided image, and all text was refactored to use translation keys from . Fee text was removed.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Layout.js**
    -   **Importance**: Provides the consistent structure for all pages, including the header (with logo and language selector) and the footer. It's the central place for global styles and layout.
    -   **Changes**: The main background color and image were set here. The  component was added to the header. The footer was updated to include the user-provided giveaway image.

-   **/app/frontend/src/i18n/**
    -   **Importance**: This directory contains the entire internationalization setup.  configures the  instance, and the  subdirectory holds the JSON files with key-value pairs for all 10 languages.
    -   **Changes**: Created from scratch to add multi-language support. All JSON files were populated with initial translations and later modified to remove fee-related text.

-   **/app/backend/server.py**
    -   **Importance**: The main file for the FastAPI backend. It defines API endpoints.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to include basic API structure and endpoints (, , ), although the database logic for saving entries and clicks is not yet fully implemented.
</code_architecture>
<pending_tasks>
- **Complete Internationalization**: The i18n framework is in place, but translations need to be implemented across all components, especially , , and . The z-index issue with the language dropdown menu needs to be fixed.
- **Backend Logic Implementation**: The backend API endpoints (, , admin routes) are defined but lack the full database interaction logic (verifying transactions, inserting records into MongoDB/Postgres) as specified in the initial requirements.
- **Full End-to-End Testing**: The wallet connection and smart contract  function need to be fully tested to ensure the front-to-back flow works correctly.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was executing a user request to remove all mentions of the 0.00098 BNB registration fee from the entire application. This was a multi-step refactoring process that involved:

1.  **Code Modification**: Editing the frontend components, specifically  and , to remove the hardcoded fee text from buttons and descriptive paragraphs.
    -   The button text in  was changed from  to .
    -   Descriptive text referencing the fee was removed from  and .

2.  **Translation File Updates**: Systematically editing all 10 language JSON files located in  to remove the text values associated with the fee. This included keys like  and .

This task was in its final stages. The engineer had successfully edited the UI components and was working through each of the 10 language files (, , , etc.) one by one. The trajectory concluded just after the  (Indonesian) file was updated, with the next logical action being the cleanup of the now-unused translation keys from these files.

<optional_next_step>
Remove the now-unused entryFee translation keys from all 10 language files in  to finalize the fee removal task.
