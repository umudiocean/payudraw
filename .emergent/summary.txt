The trajectory chronicles the development and iterative refinement of the Payu Squid Game crypto giveaway application. The initial phase focused on building the core architecture: a React frontend with Wagmi/RainbowKit for wallet connectivity and a FastAPI backend with MongoDB. A significant early effort was dedicated to implementing multi-language support using .

A major portion of the work involved an extensive and problematic debugging process for a non-functional language selector. This involved multiple failed attempts to fix re-rendering issues, event propagation, and configuration problems with the  library, eventually leading to the user requesting its complete removal in favor of an English-only application.

Subsequent development was driven by user feedback, leading to several key feature changes. A streamlined user experience was implemented, where a single Join the Giveaway button handles both wallet connection and automatic registration, followed by a celebratory modal. The  page was modified to first include, and then later remove, input fields for social media handles to simplify the task completion flow. The backend was updated to persist and retrieve completed task statuses for returning users. The  page was simplified by removing several informational sections.

The final set of tasks involved fixing an Invalid Date bug and modernizing the UI on the  page. This modernization effort resulted in a JSX syntax error, which is the immediate issue that needs to be resolved.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a Payu Giveaway web application themed after Squid Game. The application is a crypto-based giveaway where users can participate by connecting their Web3 wallet.

**Core User Flow:**
1.  **Landing Page ():** A visually engaging page with a Pepe Squid Game hero image and a prominent, single call-to-action (CTA) button: JOIN THE GIVEAWAY / CONNECT WALLET. A countdown timer displays the time remaining.
2.  **Automatic Registration:** Clicking the CTA prompts the user to connect their wallet. Upon successful connection, the user is automatically registered for the giveaway and receives a unique ticket number.
3.  **Post-Registration:** A celebratory modal appears, confirming their registration and ticket number. The user is then directed to the  page.
4.  **Task Completion ():** Users can complete three optional social media tasks (Telegram, X, Instagram) by clicking buttons that open the respective links. Completion is tracked automatically. A congratulatory, animated modal appears after all three tasks are finished.
5.  **View Entries ():** Users can view their registration details and the status of their completed tasks on a modern, animated page.

**Admin Functionality:**
-   An admin panel (), accessible only to a specific wallet address (), allows viewing all participant data and exporting it as a CSV file.

The application must be English-only and feature a consistent Payu Giveaway branding, replacing all previous mentions of Draw or Raffle. The UI/UX emphasizes a high-contrast, neon aesthetic with custom fonts (, ) for readability.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python).
- **Database:** MongoDB.
- **Blockchain:** Wagmi and RainbowKit for wallet connectivity and interaction.
- **Styling:** Custom fonts (, ) and CSS animations defined in  and  to create the Squid Game theme.
- **State Management:** React hooks (, ) for managing component state, including wallet connection status, task completion, and modal visibility.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This page displays the user's registration details and task completion status.
    -   **Changes:** It was heavily refactored to fix an Invalid Date display bug and to modernize the UI with new styles and animations. This refactoring introduced a JSX syntax error, which is the current blocker.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main user interaction page for completing social media tasks after registration.
    -   **Changes:** The logic was updated multiple times. It now features an automatic registration flow triggered on wallet connection, a celebratory modal on successful registration, another on task completion, and a simplified task system that no longer asks for user input. It also fetches the user's previously completed tasks from the backend.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The application's landing page.
    -   **Changes:** Simplified by removing several informational sections (How It Works, stats, etc.). The main change was combining two buttons into a single, prominent CTA that triggers the wallet connection and automatic registration flow.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Provides the global structure, including the header and footer.
    -   **Changes:** The  component was removed, and a link to the  page was added to the navigation bar.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main API server.
    -   **Changes:** Endpoints were added to get a user's task completion status by wallet address. An admin-only middleware was added to protect sensitive endpoints, checking the wallet address from a custom header ().

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The entry point for the React app.
    -   **Changes:** Updated to include Google Fonts links for  to improve typography and readability.

-   ** & **
    -   **Importance:** Defines the application's visual theme.
    -   **Changes:** Updated to define  as the body font and  as the display font. Global CSS was added to improve line-height and default text colors for better readability on the dark background.

<pending_tasks>
- Fix the JSX syntax error in  that was introduced during the UI modernization refactor. The error is Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent task was to address user feedback on the  page. The user reported two issues:
1.  An Invalid Date string was being displayed for timestamps.
2.  The page's design was not modern and lacked effects or animations.

The previous engineer attempted to solve both issues by completely refactoring the  component. The date formatting logic was fixed, and new, animated JSX was written to create a more modern user interface.

However, this refactoring introduced a critical compilation error:


This error prevents the frontend from compiling and running. The immediate work is to debug and fix this JSX syntax issue in the  file.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Fix the JSX syntax error in  by wrapping the adjacent elements in a parent element or a React Fragment ().
