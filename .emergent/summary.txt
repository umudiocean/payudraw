The trajectory documents the development of the Payu Squid Game crypto lottery application, from its initial specification to a highly stylized, feature-rich state. The process began with building the foundational frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI) architecture, integrating wallet connectivity with Wagmi/RainbowKit, and setting up multi-language support (i18next).

The development was highly iterative, driven by direct user feedback. The initial work involved removing all mentions of an entry fee from the UI and all 10 translation files. Subsequently, the engineer completed the internationalization of all pages (, , ). A critical backend bug involving MongoDB ObjectId serialization was identified and fixed during automated testing.

The latter half of the trajectory focused on a massive UI/UX overhaul. The user requested progressively more sophisticated designs, leading to multiple full-theme refactors. This involved implementing custom fonts (), several distinct color palettes (culminating in a high-contrast ice blue, pink, and gold scheme), and complex CSS animations. Key features like a sequential, game-like task system on the  page and a new Pepe Squid Game hero section were also added.

The work was interrupted immediately after the user reported that the language selector component was non-functional and not readable. The last action was reading the component's file to begin debugging and redesigning it.

<product_requirements>
The objective is to create a Payu Squid Game themed cryptocurrency lottery web application. Users connect their wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to participate in a draw by calling a smart contract on the BSC Mainnet.

**Core Functionality:**
-   **User Flow:** Connect wallet, join the draw via a smart contract call, receive a ticket, and complete optional social media tasks.
-   **Admin Panel:** A wallet-gated page for viewing participants and exporting data.
-   **Multi-Language:** Full support for 10 languages, selectable by the user.

**UI/UX Evolution:**
The initial dark theme evolved into a highly specific, animated Squid Game aesthetic.
-   **Theme:** The final design uses the  font and a high-contrast color palette (ice blue, pink, gold) on a dark background ().
-   **Animations:** Extensive use of custom CSS animations (glow, float, pulse) on UI elements and background symbols (◯ △ ⬜).
-   **Gamification:** The  page features a sequential task system where completing one social media task (e.g., Telegram) unlocks the next, enhancing user engagement.
-   **Branding:** The hero section features a Pepe Squid Game character image.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React, Create React App (CRACO), Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python).
- **Blockchain:** Wagmi and RainbowKit for wallet connection and smart contract interaction.
- **Internationalization (i18n):**  and  for managing translations across 10 JSON files.
- **Styling:** Heavy customization of  for themes (colors, fonts, keyframe animations) and global CSS variables for dynamic styling.
- **Database:** MongoDB, with a key fix implemented for ObjectId serialization issues.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Central hub for the application's visual theme. It defines the custom color palettes, font families (), and complex CSS keyframe animations that are crucial to the Squid Game aesthetic.
    -   **Changes:** This file was modified extensively through multiple iterations to update colors, add fonts, and define custom animations like , , , and .

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The primary page for user interaction, handling wallet connection, registration, and tasks.
    -   **Changes:** Underwent a massive transformation. All text was internationalized. A critical  bug on an undefined variable was fixed. Most significantly, it was redesigned to include a sequential, game-like task system with state management () and heavy CSS animations for a modern, engaging user experience.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The application's landing page.
    -   **Changes:** Completely redesigned to align with the evolving Squid Game theme. The hero section was updated with a new Pepe Squid Game image and headline. Static content was replaced with animated, themed cards.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Provides the global page structure (header, footer, background).
    -   **Changes:** Refactored to implement the global theme, including a new header with animated logo/symbols, and a redesigned footer. It's the component that ties the overall visual identity together.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Contains all translated strings for the 10 supported languages.
    -   **Changes:** Initially populated, then edited to remove fee-related text. Later, they were all updated in bulk to add new keys for the internationalization of , , and .

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The FastAPI backend server defining all API endpoints.
    -   **Changes:** The code was validated by the  agent, which confirmed all 13 endpoints were functional and fixed a critical MongoDB ObjectId serialization bug without manual code edits.

<pending_tasks>
- **Fix Language Selector:** The primary pending task is to fix the language selector component. The user reported that it is not working, is not easily readable, and does not change the application's language upon selection. This requires both a functional fix and a UI redesign to match the current theme.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate task at hand is addressing the user's feedback about the broken language selector. The user explicitly stated: language options are not working and please make it more readable. whichever language the user chooses, the whole app should be translated to that language.

This request points to two issues:
1.  **Functionality:** The  function is likely not being called correctly, or the component's state is not properly managed, preventing the application from re-rendering with the selected language.
2.  **UI/UX:** The component's styling does not align with the new high-contrast theme ( font, ice blue/pink/gold colors), making it difficult to read and visually inconsistent with the rest of the application.

The previous engineer had just begun to address this by reading the contents of the relevant file to understand its current implementation.

**File being worked on:**
-   

**Last Action:**
The last action was reading the  file to prepare for refactoring. No code has been modified yet for this specific task.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Refactor  to fix its functionality and update its styling to align with the new high-contrast Squid Game theme for improved readability and visual consistency.
