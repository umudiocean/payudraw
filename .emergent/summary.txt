The trajectory details an extensive debugging and feature implementation cycle for the Payu Squid Game application. The work began by addressing a blocking JSX syntax error in , which was successfully resolved, allowing the frontend to compile.

Following this fix, the user requested the addition of more wallet options (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Binance, Coinbase, Trust Wallet). This initiated a prolonged and complex debugging phase. Attempts to update the RainbowKit configuration led to a persistent and critical runtime error related to the MetaMask SDK: . The AI engineer went through multiple strategies to resolve this, including downgrading packages, completely removing and then re-installing web3 dependencies (, ), and cleaning the project's .

This process temporarily broke all wallet functionality, leading to follow-up errors like module not found and undefined hooks (). The engineer systematically resolved these by removing stale imports and mock-disabling web3 features to get the application back to a stable, runnable state without core functionality.

Finally, the engineer successfully re-implemented the wallet connection feature from scratch using stable versions of  and . This restored the required user flow: clicking JOIN THE GIVEAWAY opens a wallet modal, and connecting automatically registers the user. The final phase involved fixing user-reported logic and UI bugs, including an incorrect registration status check, poor readability on the  page, and a critical React Router issue that prevented page navigation from rendering new components. All reported issues were successfully resolved by the end of the trajectory.

<product_requirements>
The objective is to build and maintain the Payu Giveaway, a Squid Game-themed crypto giveaway application.

**Core User Flow &amp; Features:**
1.  **Landing Page ():** A visually engaging page with a single JOIN THE GIVEAWAY call-to-action (CTA) button and a countdown timer.
2.  **Wallet Connection:** Clicking the CTA must open a wallet connection modal offering multiple wallet choices, including MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, and Rainbow Wallet, with their official logos.
3.  **Automatic Registration:** Upon successfully connecting a wallet for the first time, the user must be automatically registered for the giveaway. The application must correctly detect if a user has already registered and not prompt them to register again.
4.  **Task &amp; Entries Pages:**
    *   : A page where users can view their registration status and perform social media tasks.
    *   : A page for users to view their giveaway ticket number and other entry details with high readability.
5.  **Admin Panel ():** A protected route for administrative functions.

The application must be stable, free of compilation and runtime errors, and ensure all navigation and core functionalities work as expected.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python).
- **Database:** MongoDB.
- **Web3/Blockchain:**
    -  (v1) for React hooks interacting with the blockchain.
    -  (v1.3.6) for the multi-wallet connection modal and UI components.
- **Routing:**  for client-side navigation.
- **State Management:** React Hooks (, ) are used for component-level state.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo containing a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
    - **Importance:** The main application component that sets up routing and global providers like  and .
    - **Summary of Changes:** This file was heavily modified throughout the trajectory. It was the central point for configuring, debugging, removing, and ultimately re-implementing the wallet connection providers. The final major change was fixing a critical routing issue by restructuring how  routes were defined within the component.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Contains the configuration for , defining the blockchain networks (chains) and connectors.
    - **Summary of Changes:** This file was created and modified to support the re-implementation of a stable wallet connection. It was downgraded to use  v1 syntax, defining  and  to resolve dependency conflicts and runtime errors.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Handles the user registration logic after wallet connection and displays social media tasks.
    - **Summary of Changes:** This file's  hooks (, ) were removed and re-added multiple times during the debugging process. The logic was ultimately refined to correctly check for both on-chain and backend registration status to prevent showing Register Now to already-registered users. References to a defunct  were also removed.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Displays the user's registration details and ticket number.
    - **Summary of Changes:** The initial task was to fix a JSX syntax error in this file. Later, UI elements were modified to improve the readability of the ticket number and other data by adjusting CSS classes (e.g., text color, background, and font size).

- ****
    - **Importance:** The application's landing page containing the main JOIN THE GIVEAWAY CTA.
    - **Summary of Changes:** The primary button was integrated with RainbowKit's  component to trigger the wallet selection modal, replacing a simpler navigation link.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Manages frontend dependencies.
    - **Summary of Changes:** The versions for  and  were manually changed, and dependencies were removed and re-added multiple times to resolve the persistent MetaMask SDK runtime error. The final stable configuration uses  and .

<pending_tasks>
- There are no outstanding tasks. All user-reported bugs and feature requests from the trajectory have been addressed, and the application is in a stable, fully functional state.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent work involved resolving a set of critical user-reported issues and a bug found by the testing agent, bringing the application to a fully functional and stable state.

1.  **Fixed Routing Bug:** A critical issue where navigating between pages (e.g., from Home to Join) would change the URL but not update the displayed component was resolved. This was fixed by refactoring the routing structure in  to correctly render child routes.

2.  **Corrected Registration Logic:** The user reported that the  page incorrectly prompted already-registered users to Register Now. The logic was updated to more reliably check the user's registration status from both the backend and the blockchain, ensuring the correct UI is displayed.

3.  **Improved UI Readability:** The user pointed out that ticket numbers and other details on the  page were difficult to read. This was addressed by modifying the Tailwind CSS classes on the page to enhance text contrast, size, and background color, significantly improving readability.

4.  **Re-enabled Wallet Functionality:** Prior to these fixes, the core wallet connection feature was re-implemented from the ground up using stable versions of  and  to resolve a persistent MetaMask SDK runtime error.

The application is now stable, all pages render correctly, wallet connection works as intended, and the UI/UX issues have been fixed.
